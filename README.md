# Public-SEC-Filings-QA-LLM-RAG
Building GPT 4o-based QA Chatbot to retrieve information about an Organization's SEC filings. It features functions to download 10-K filings, preprocess text into chunks, create a vector database for efficient retrieval, and build a QA system with or without Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system can answer questions based on SEC filings and includes testing pipelines for predefined and user-input questions.  The project is useful for contextual understanding, and financial analysis, enabling quick extraction of key insights from SEC filings.
